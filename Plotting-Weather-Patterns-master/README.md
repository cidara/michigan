# Plotting-Weather-Patterns

This is an assignment from coursera where the goal is to :

1. Read the documentation and familiarize yourself with the dataset, then write some python code which returns a line graph of 
the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 
2005-2014. The area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day should be shaded.

2. Overlay a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015.
Watch out for leap days (i.e. February 29th), it is reasonable to remove these points from the dataset for 
the purpose of this visualization.

2. Make the visual nice! Leverage principles from the first module in this course when developing your solution. 
Consider issues such as legends, labels, and chart junk.

The data you have been given is near Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States, and the stations the data comes 
from are shown on the map below.

I am proud of my accomplishment because I took a particulary attention on Months and days in order the clearly draw the time series.
